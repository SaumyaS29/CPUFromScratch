# CPUFromScratch
This is a hobby project of mine where I use the principles of logic design and create an 8-bit toy CPU from the ground up. I have implemented its circuit in the Logisim simulator. This is a very basic CPU - having only four general purpose registers and only 7 instructions in its instruction set. There are no instructions for branching, looping and control-flow.

In addition to this, I have also written an assembler in C for this CPU which reads an assembly source file and converts it into machine instructions understood by this toy CPU.
